      "\t* Ask for the reason and details (optional).\n",
      "\t* Provide an estimated timeline for the process.\n",
      "\t* Offer options to approve, decline, or modify the request.\n",
      "5. **Product Recommendations**: The chatbot should recommend products based on users' previous orders and preferences. This will involve integrating the recommendation system.\n",
      "6. **Search**: Users can search for specific products by typing keywords, product names, or SKUs. Results should include relevant information (price, description, images).\n",
      "7. **Filtering and Sorting**: Users should be able to filter results by price, brand, category, and rating. They can also sort the list by price, popularity, or relevance.\n",
      "8. **Order History**: The chatbot should allow users to view their order history, including previous orders, cancellations, returns, and refunds.\n",
      "9. **Product Catalog Integration**: Users should be able to browse products directly from the chatbot, with links to product details pages (if available).\n",
